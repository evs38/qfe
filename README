QFE - Qt FTN Message Editor (C) 2005-2006 by Alexander Shiyan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ *** Description *** ]
 QFE is an FTN message editor. A full-featured cross-platform FTN message
editor with a graphical interface. It written on C++/Qt and does not depend on
either KDE, Gnome or other window managers.
 Fido-specific parameters readed by fidoconfig package from Husky project.
I write qfe for Linux, but it works also on Win32 and MacOS X, and in theory,
it should compile & work on all other Qt-supported platforms.
 To learn more about 'QFE' please see the various documents in the doc folder.

[ *** Requirements *** ]
 QFE is based on Trolltech's Qt library 3.2.x or above, but 4.x.x is not
supported yet, so be sure you have the correct library version installed.
To compile QFE from sources You also need have installed Qt devel headers.
 QFE now sucessfully compiled with:
 On Linux:   GNU GCC   (3.x.x & 4.x.x),
             Intel C++ (9.x).
 On MacOS X: GNU GCC (3.3.x).
 On Windows: MinGW GCC (3.3.x).
 Also You need fidoconfig package from husky project (http://husky.sourceforge.net/)
and apply patch to husky for compile headers under C++ (located in qfe/misc/husky.patch).

[ *** License *** ]
 QFE is released under GNU General Public License (GPL).

[ *** Quick-Compile & Install Guide *** ]
 tar -xf qfe-0.5.tar.bz2
 cd qfe
 ./configure
 make
 make install #As a user with proper file system permissions

 For link fidoconfig library statically, you must add parameter "staticlibs" to
qmake, e.g. qmake "CONFIG+=debug_off staticlibs"

 QFE must be compiled with lot of debug messages, printed to stdout. Debug
switches on if "-d" parameter passed to commandline, e.g. ./qfe -d

 By default, program installs in /usr/local. For install in another directory
You must (before doing qmake) export QFE_PREFIX variable with base install path,
e.g. export QFE_PREFIX=/usr, or use commandline option '--prefix' for configure
script.
 Some another installation tips located in FAQ. Read it first.

[ *** Help Wanted *** ]
 There are many ways to support this program:
* Creating packages for the various distributions.
* Translate 'QFE' to your language.
* Testing, searching for bugs and sending bug reports.
* But also every idea (or even patch) to improve the program is always welcome!

[ *** Bugs *** ]
 QFE is a new project, so you may find many problems. If you can't find the
solution, please contact us.
 Please also report bugs and/or wishes with the 'QFE' bug tracker
