======= QFE - Qt FTN Message Editor. =======
==== (C) 2005-2006 by Alexander Shiyan =====
 QFE is an full-featured FTN message editor
with a graphical interface. Written with
Trolltech Qt-library.
Program written for Linux, but it works also
on Win32 and MacOS X, and in theory, it
should compile and work on all Qt-supported
platforms.
